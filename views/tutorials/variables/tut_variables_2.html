			<!-- Why -->
			<h2>Why</h2>
			<article class="textInfo">
				Something important to remember is that computer's are really good at doing what you tell them to do, but nothing else.<br><br>
				You have to tell them to do everything, and they'll only ever do what you tell them to do.<br><br>
				This is why comparing variables is important. The computer doesn't know to check the value of a variable unless you tell it to.<br><br>
				The moment after the variable is set, the computer forgets what the value is, unless you tell it to check later.<br><br>
				Comparing two variables, or a variable and a normal value, is for when you want to check on the value of the variable when it changes.<br><br>
				You will learn more uses later, with things like branching and looping.<br><br><br>

			<!-- What -->
			<h2 style="margin-top: 3.0em;">What</h2>
			<article class="textInfo">
				The comparison block has two types. One for numbers, and one for bools.<br><br>
				Both have two spaces for variables or values, but have something different in the middle. <br><br>
				The numbers one starts off with "=", and the bool one starts off with the word "and".<br><br>
				There are several different options for the numbers comparison block, and one other option for the bool one.<br><br>
				Now, this is an explanation of the different options. If it's too many words, you can come back whenever you need to.<br><br>
				"=" means that the comparison is checking for if the values in both spaces are exactly the same. If they are, the comparison is "true", otherwise it's "false."<br><br>
				The "=" with a slash through it means that the comparison is checking for if the values in both spaces are not the same. If they are the same, the comparison is "false", otherwise it's "true."<br><br>
				The ">" means "greater than". If the value to the left is bigger than the value to the right, then it's "true", otherwise it's "false". (For example, 5 > 2)<br><br>
				The "<" means "less than". If the value to the left is smaller than the value to the right, then it's "true", otherwise it's "false". (For example, 2 < 5)<br><br>
				The ">" with the extra line means "greater than or equal to." It works like a combination of the ">" and "=" blocks.<br><br>
				The "<" with the extra line means "less than or equal to." It works like a combination of the "<" and "=" blocks.<br><br><br>
				Now to the bool options. The "and" means that both values need to be true for the comparison to be true, otherwise it's false.<br><br>
				The "or" means that only one of the values need to be true for the comparison to be true as well.<br><br><br>
			</article>
			
			<!-- How -->
			<h2>How</h2>
			<article class="textInfo">
				After dragging the block into the workspace, just drag either a varaible "call" block or a number/string/bool block into the spaces.<br><br>
				Clicking on the "=" or "and" part will let you change it to the other options.<br><br>
				Now, normally a check on it's own isn't all that useful, so later tutorials will show the true power of these blocks.<br><br>
