			<!-- Why -->
			<h2>Why</h2>
			<article class="textInfo">
				Variables are how programmers tell the computer to hold onto information that the programmers want to handle later.<br><br>
				Typically, this means it's something that's going to change later on, or is something that is too long to re-type as the programmer needs it.<br><br>
				The usage and need for variable is something you will appreciate as you reach more complicated coding.<br><br><br>

			<!-- What -->
			<h2 style="margin-top: 3.0em;">What</h2>
			<article class="textInfo">
				A variable is a part of the computer's memory that is called by it's "variable name".<br><br>
				So if I have some variable that I call "variable_1", then whenever I type "variable_1" later, the computer knows what I'm talking about.<br><br>
				"Setting" a variable is when you tell the computer what the variable's value is.<br><br>
				So if I 'set' variable_1 to 15, the computer knows that when I tell it "variable_1", it should use 15 there, instead of some other value.<br><br><br>
				There are three types of variables. Numbers, 'strings', and 'bools'.<br><br>
				You know what numbers are, but the other two are probably confusing.<br><br>
				"Strings" are a group of letters and (sometimes) spaces. They can be a single word, or a whole sentence.<br><br> 
				Use them when you need the computer to say something, or store something someone else has said.<br><br>
				"Bools" are a little more conceptual. A bool is a variable that is either true, or false. And that's it. <br><br>
				You'll see how and why you'd use them next tutorial.<br><br><br>

			<!-- How -->
			<h2>How</h2>
			<article class="textInfo">
				As you can see from the above image, there are two blocks that you'll need for variables.<br><br>
				The first is the 'set' block, that you use to set a variable's value.<br><br>
				The second is the 'call' block, that you'll use to get the variable later in your code.<br><br>
				To create a variable, you'll need one of these, drag it on to the workspace.<br><br>
				Then, click on the name, and you'll see a menu pop up. You can delete it, or rename it.<br><br>
				Renaming it is how you'll distinguish two different variables, in case you need more than one.<br><br>
				To set the variable, you'll need one of the blocks you can see below. You can set a variable to either ints, strings, or a bool but not more than 1.<br><br><br>
